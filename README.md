# Web Browser

Web Browser is a simple web browser application built using PyQt5 and QtWebEngine. It allows you to browse the web, navigate between web pages, and maintain a history of visited URLs.

## Features

- **URL Navigation**: Enter a URL in the address bar and press "Go" to navigate to the web page.
- **Back and Forward**: Use the "Back" and "Forward" buttons to navigate backward and forward through the browsing history.
- **History**: View a list of previously visited URLs and click on an item to quickly revisit it.
- **Clear History**: Clear the browsing history to remove all stored URLs.
- **Search**: If a valid URL is not entered in the address bar, the application treats the input as a search query and performs a Google search.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- QtWebEngine
